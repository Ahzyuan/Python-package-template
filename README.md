## ðŸ“¦ A Project template for self-developed Python package

> Note: This repo inspired by https://github.com/navdeep-G/setup.py, and has been modified in strict accordance with the requirements of its open source license, in order to get a better experience.

This repo exists to provide a project structure template, that can be used to guide you in developing third-party Python packages.

It has the following characteristics:

- A relatively complete software engineering project structure, including [code directory](package-name), [test directory](tests), [document directory](docs), and [demonstration directory](examples)

- `setup.py` is a collection of useful patterns and best practices. It extends the `python setup.py` command to achieve one-step code updates, package builds, and releases to [PyPi](https://pypi.org/) using `Twine`.

## ðŸ”¨Getting Started

```bash
# <project-root> stand for anywhere you want to store your project
cd <project-root> 

# Note: specify the project name you want to use
git clone https://github.com/Ahzyuan/Python-package-template.git <your-project-name>

# replace <your-project-repo-url> with your repo url
cd <your-project-name>
git remote set-url origin <your-project-repo-url>
git pull 

# modify License, remember to specify your name below
# default license is MIT
sed -i "3s/<COPYRIGHT HOLDER>/your-name/" LICENSE
sed -i "3s/<YEAR>/$(date +%Y)/" LICENSE
```
after that, you should still configure the following files:
1. `setup.py`: modify the variables in upper case, such as `NAME`, `AUTHOR`, `EMAIL`, `DESCRIPTION`...
2. `requirements.txt`: add your dependencies
3. `MANIFEST.in`: configure which files should be included in the package
4. `package-name/__version__.py`: specify the version of your package, **ensure this file exist!!!**

## ðŸ“‘ To Do

- [ ] Add CI/CD support, such as GitHub Actions
- [ ] Add pyproject support
